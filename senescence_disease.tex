\section{Introduction}

Senescence is the last developmental stage of plant cells, tissues, organs, and, in the case of monocarpic species, the entire plant. Once senescence has been initiated, it typically leads to a massive remobilization of phloem-mobile nutrients from the senescing plant parts to developing sinks, such as seeds and grains of monocarpic crops. In this context, nitrogen holds a special position. It is the quantitatively most important plant mineral nutrient, and nitrogen-containing macromolecules  have to be hydrolysed and converted to glutamate, glutamine and (to a lesser extent) other amino acids prior to phloem loading and transport to developing sinks \cite{Distelfeld27012014}.

\section{Material \& Methods}

\subsection{Plant Material}
The eight-parent MAGIC population described by \cite{Mackay01092014} was used for all phenotypic screening. Briefly, the complete population consists of more than >1000 lines generated from three rounds of inter-crossing between eight elite United Kingdom wheat varieties (Alchemy, Brompton, Claire, Hereward, Rialto, Robigus, Soissons, Xi19) followed by five rounds of selfing to remove heterozygosity. 

\subsection{Glass House Cultivation}
An experiment with duration of six weeks was conducted between mid January 2015 and mid April 2015 in The National Plant Phenomics Centre greenhouse facilities in Aberystwyth, UK. The MAGIC parents as well as 208 lines (see Supporting Information, Table S1) were grown under a well watered conditions with two replicates per genotype. The experiment was designed using randomised blocks (Fig. 1, Table S1).

Single plants were grown in ? L plastic containers with ? kg of soil (content ?). N number of seeds? seeds per pot were directly sown into the soil and after germination thinned out, leaving one plant per pot. Plants were pre-grown for two weeks in a regular greenhouse and watering was performed manually to allow optimal germination and seedling establishment. Subsequently, the pots were transferred to the “smart house” where each pot was placed onto a cart on a conveyor belt. Every day, pots were weighed and watered automatically to ?\% gravimetric water content (Fig. 2). The experiments were carried out under natural lighting with the temperature in the greenhouse kept at a range between ?°C (night) and ?°C (day).

\subsection{Plant infection}
Wheat plants were naturally infected with a pathogen. Symptoms (visual and enviroment) ponted to the pathogen Tan Spot.

\subsection{phenotyping}
Plants were phenotyped from the start of the experiment. Plant images were captured using a LemnaTec 3D Scanalyzer (LemnaTec, GmbH, Wuerselen, Germany). Every day, three RGB pictures (2056×2454 pixels) were taken of each wheat plant, one top view image and two side view images with a 90° horizontal rotation. After background-foreground separation was applied to separate the plant tissue area from the background, pixel numbers per plant were counted and the pixel sum of the three pictures per plant was taken to define the biomass %{projected shoot area. The shoot area measured over time was used to draw growth curves. For each growth curve, curve fitting with a 6th order polynomial was conducted to adjust for possible missing data points and absolute growth rate [dA/dt] and relative growth rate [(dA/dt)/A] were calculated. For each of the three curves the integral was determined and used as a trait in the statistical analysis}. 
Moreover, six further traits were extracted from the images; caliper length, height, color (as hue angle in the HSI color scheme) and the two parameters shoot area top view and convex hull area to calculate compactness of each plant. At the end of the experiment, barley plants were harvested and above ground biomass, tiller number (TIL), and plant height (HEI) were determined. Fresh biomass was weighed and, subsequently, oven dried to constant weight to determine dry biomass. Water use efficiency (WUE) was calculated by dividing dry biomass at the end of the experiment by the total amount of water added during the four weeks in the “smart house” [mg/g water]. Specific plant weight (SPW) was calculated from the dry weight and the maximum projected shoot area at the end of the experiment. In addition, simple stress indices (SSI) were calculated as follows: SSI = Ts/Tc, where Ts and Tc are the average trait performances of an IL under stress and control conditions, respectively. An overview of trait definitions is given in Table 1.
\subsection{Statistical Analysis}
Statistical analyses were performed using the R environment \cite{RManual}.
