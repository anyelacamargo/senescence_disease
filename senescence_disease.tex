\section*{Disclosure/Conflict-of-Interest Statement}
%Frontiers follows the recommendations by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (http://www.icmje.org/ethical_4conflicts.html) which require that all financial, commercial or other relationships that might be perceived by the academic community as representing a potential conflict of interest must be disclosed. If no such relationship exists, authors will be asked to declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. When disclosing the potential conflict of interest, the authors need to address the following points:
%•	Did you or your institution at any time receive payment or services from a third party for any aspect of the submitted work?
%•	Please declare financial relationships with entities that could be perceived to influence, or that give the appearance of potentially influencing, what you wrote in the submitted work.
%•	Please declare patents and copyrights, whether pending, issued, licensed and/or receiving royalties relevant to the work.
%•	Please state other relationships or activities that readers could perceive to have influenced, or that give the appearance of potentially influencing, what you wrote in the submitted work.

The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.

\section*{Author Contributions}
%When determining authorship the following criteria should be observed:
%•	Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND
%•	Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND
%•	Final approval of the version to be published ; AND
%•	Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.
%Contributors who meet fewer than all 4 of the above criteria for authorship should not be listed as authors, but they should be acknowledged. (http://www.icmje.org/roles_a.html)

%%% Upload the *bib file along with the *tex file and PDF on submission if the bibliography is not in the main *tex file

\section*{Figures}

%%% Use this if adding the figures directly in the mansucript, if so, please remember to also upload the files when submitting your article
%%% There is no need for adding the file termination, as long as you indicate where the file is saved. In the examples below the files (logo1.jpg and logo2.eps) are in the Frontiers LaTeX folder
%%% If using *.tif files convert them to .jpg or .png

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{logo1}% This is a *.jpg file
\end{center}
 \textbf{\refstepcounter{figure}\label{fig:01} Figure \arabic{figure}.}{ Enter the caption for your figure here.  Repeat as  necessary for each of your figures }
\end{figure}

%\begin{figure}
%\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[width=10cm]{logo2}% This is an *.eps file
%\end{center}
%\textbf{\refstepcounter{figure}\label{fig:02} Figure \arabic{figure}.}{ Enter the caption for your figure here.  Repeat as  necessary for each of your figures }
%\end{figure}

%%% If you don't add the figures in the LaTeX files, please upload them when submitting the article.

%%% Frontiers will add the figures at the end of the provisional pdf automatically %%%

%%% The use of LaTeX coding to draw Diagrams/Figures/Structures should be avoided. They should be external callouts including graphics.
